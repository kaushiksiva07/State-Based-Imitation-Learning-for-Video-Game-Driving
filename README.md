# State-Based-Imitation-Learning-for-Video-Game-Driving
Code contains model architecture, training loop, and data collection. Data collection used stored pickle files from running matches which contain state information. This was aggregated based on either Team 1 or Team 2
whether we were looking for imitation learning or DAgger learning. Imitation uses data collected from running a pre-existing agent while DAgger data was collected from our own agent being run against other agents.
